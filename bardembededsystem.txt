Roadmap to becoming an embedded systems engineer (self-learning):
Phase 1: Foundation Building (1-2 years)
Programming:
Master C: This is the cornerstone of embedded systems development. Start with online courses like Harvard's CS50 or MIT's 6.S191x, then progress to books like "The C Programming Language" by K&R and practice with projects like LED blinking on an Arduino.
Explore C++: This adds object-oriented features to C. Udemy or Coursera have good beginner courses. Get familiar with concepts like classes, inheritance, and templates.
Consider Assembly Language: Understanding how the processor works at a low level can be beneficial. Start with simple instructions and work your way up.
Electronics Basics:
Learn Circuits: Grasp concepts like basic components (resistors, capacitors, transistors), Ohm's Law, voltage & current, and circuit analysis. Online courses like "Basic Electronics" by Udemy or books like "Make: Electronics" are good resources.
Digital Logic: Understand digital signals, logic gates, flip flops, and combinational/sequential circuits. Khan Academy has a nice course, or try books like "Digital Design with an Introduction to HDL" by Morris Mano.
Microcontrollers:
Pick a Platform: Start with beginner-friendly boards like Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Follow tutorials, build simple projects, and experiment with sensors, actuators, and communication protocols.
Move to Bare-metal Programming: Graduate to platforms like STM32 or MSP430. Learn to program directly on the microcontroller without an operating system. This involves understanding register manipulation, memory management, and device drivers.
Mathematics:
Brush up on Math: Refresh your linear algebra, calculus, and probability & statistics skills. Khan Academy or MOOCs can help. These are crucial for understanding signal processing, control systems, and machine learning applied in embedded systems.
Phase 2: Deepening Your Knowledge (1-2 years)
Operating Systems:
Real-time Operating Systems (RTOS): Learn about RTOS concepts like scheduling, concurrency, and communication. Explore FreeRTOS or Zephyr RTOS through online courses and projects.
Linux for Embedded Systems: Get familiar with embedded Linux distributions like YoctoProject or Buildroot. Understand device drivers, bootloaders, and file systems.
Communication Protocols:
Master I2C, SPI, UART: These are commonly used protocols for interfacing with sensors, actuators, and other devices. Online resources and experimentation with your microcontroller boards will do wonders.
Explore Wireless Protocols: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and LoRaWAN are increasingly used in embedded systems. Choose some based on your interests and explore their implementation specifics.
Advanced Topics:
Embedded Security: Learn about security threats and mitigation techniques relevant to embedded systems.
Embedded Networking: Understand network protocols like TCP/IP and build projects involving internet connectivity.
Embedded Vision/Machine Learning: If you're interested, explore libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow Lite for embedded applications.
Phase 3: Professional Development (Ongoing)
Build a Portfolio: Showcase your projects on platforms like GitHub. Participate in hackathons and contribute to open-source projects.
Networking: Connect with other embedded engineers online and offline. Attend conferences and workshops.
Certifications: Consider certifications like Certified Embedded Systems Engineer (CESE) to validate your skills and enhance your resume.
Continuous Learning: Stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the embedded space. Read technical articles, attend webinars, and keep learning new things.

Additional Tips:
Join online communities: Forums and Facebook groups like "Embedded Systems Weekly" are great for asking questions and staying updated.
Contribute to open-source projects: This is a fantastic way to learn from experienced developers and gain practical experience.
Focus on problem-solving: Embedded systems development involves solving real-world problems with limited resources. Hone your problem-solving skills and critical thinking.
Don't be afraid to experiment: Try new things, break things, and learn from your mistakes. Embedded systems development is a hands-on field, so don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.
Remember, this is just a roadmap, and your journey might be different. The key is to be passionate, persistent, and keep learning. With dedication and hard work, you can become a successful embedded systems engineer even through self-learning.
Good luck!
